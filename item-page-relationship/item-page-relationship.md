# Store on which page(s) an item is

Currently ownpage can only be used for finding out the origin of the coordinates of an item.

Scribus should store (probably both in memory and in .sla) on which page(s) an item appears.

If possible, it should also have a good algorithm for defining which page "owns" the item.
