# Made with Scribus

We should propose a standard way for showing that a work has been done with Scribus.

We should have a logo and a link that explains what that means.

## Notes

### Other software

We should show all the free software that has been used, not only Scribus.

On the other sid, then the logo should be embeddable in other types of works.

We could have a QR code that contains a list of software being used.

### The logo

Inspirations for a logo:

- <https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6029/6000224458_6baf0fc3a3_z.jpg>
- <http://thevarguy.com/site-files/thevarguy.com/files/imagecache/medium_img/uploads/2015/06/opensourceletters.jpg>
- <http://creativecommons.org.au/publications/platform/call-for-papers/>

... maybe, replacing "open" with free...

### A website

We could have a website

- With a list of software you can check,
- and create a QR code,
- with a link to the site itself that shows details and links to the software used.
- And where you can download the logo in SVG, PDF, PNG, TIF...

On top of it:
- the user should be able to propose new software to be included in the list.
- the descriptions and the content should be translated in several languages.

<http://reclaimyourtools.org> could be used for it. (that's the motto of an older LGM)

This is a PHP based QR code generator: <https://github.com/t0k4rt/phpqrcode>

And a js/jquery based one:

- <https://kazuhikoarase.github.io/qrcode-generator/> (also in php)
- <https://github.com/jeromeetienne/jquery-qrcode>

Ale could create a silex based website.
