# Restore the last view

When closing a document Scribus should store:

- the active page
- the the cooderinates on the top left side
- the zoom level

 When quitting Scribus should retain:
 
 - The position and list of the palettes


The user should be able to disable all or parts of the restoration of the view (granularity is to be defined)

It is not necessary to keep on storing the information at each change.  
It is enough if Scribus stores the data when cleanly closing the file or quitting.
