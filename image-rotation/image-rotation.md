# Rotate the image in the frame

Make it possible to rotate an image inside of an image frame.

This project is not trivial, has multiple sub-tasks to be accomplished but has no hard task either.  
It can give a good overview on the way the Scribus code works.

- implement the rotation on the canvas
  - adding a rotation property to the properties palette
  - eventually adding a visual way of rotating the image (eventually by also enhancing the frame rotation itself)
- implement the pdf export of the rotated image
- implement the printing
- implement the export as PNG image
- implement the export as svg
- add the command to the scripter API

optionally:
- add a setting (or a way) to rotate the frame without rotating the image inside of it
