- [ ] get the new scripter to work again
      current state:
      - ale is stuck at connecting the signal from C++ to the Python signal
- [ ] remove or fix the scripter console
- [ ] finish the scripts downloader
- [ ] document the API
      - [ ] create / use a readthedocs account (https://scribus-scripter.readthedocs.org already exists)
      - [ ] check <http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Scripter2_API>, somehow describing the new API
      - [ ] check the new API for sanity
      - [ ] define which classes will exist in the new API and find a scema for their name and their functions
      - [ ] make a list of needed classes and function and list their matching old scripter commands
      - [ ] implement the new commandds
