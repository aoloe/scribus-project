# A new story editor

The current story editor has been created because Scribus was not good enough for in frame editing.

Since the in frame editing has largely improved over the years, we should define what are the new specifcations for a story editor and start from scratch a new implementation.

## Notes

- should it a Scribus plugin or an external application
- Use cases:
  - showing the formatting as tags
  - editing text that is hard to edit in the frame:
    - some rotated text
