# Create a notification palette

From the code we should be able to add notifications to a list.

They are non blocking, the user sees them and can act upon.

Notifications can have:

- a message
- a button applying a specific change
- a button launching a dialog
- a decay time, after which they are hidden
- an importance (making sure that important messages are shown on top of less important ones
