# Guides

The bug tracker is full of tickets relating to the guides.

- Most of them seem rather easy to be implemented.
- The way the guides work in Scribus is good, but there with a few improvements could be amazing!
- Before starting adding feature we probably need a concept.


Proposal for a concept:

- Making trivial to manual layout should replace automatic layouting
  - removing auto text frames
  - making columns inside of text frames less comfortable than using real guides and text frames for most cases (and allow converting columns in text frame to single frames)
