  - long term project
  - meta project (with a list of related projects?)

  - labels:
     - c++

     - UX
     - writing (with different languages?)
       - screenshots and screencasts
   - level of skills
       - beginner
       - knowleged

The tagging is done in a yaml section at the beggining of the markdown file in a /* ... */ comment section.
