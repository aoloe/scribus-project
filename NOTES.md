## Properties the projects

Properties

We need properties for

- tags
- complexity/scope/extent:
  - easy hack
  - less than a day
  - less than a week
  - long term project
  - meta project (with a list of related projects?)
- skills
  - labels:
     - c++
     - python
     - UI designer
     - UX
     - writing (with different languages?)
       - screenshots and screencasts
   - level of skills
       - beginner
       - knowleged
       - advanced

Further properties could be:

- start deadline
- end deadline
- founding (available/amount)

The tagging is done in a yaml section at the beggining of the markdown file in a /* ... */ comment section.
