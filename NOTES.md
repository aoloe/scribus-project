# Notes

## Tagging the projects

We need to tag the projects for

- type of project
  - easy hack
  - hours of work
  - days of work
  - long term project
  - meta project (with a list of related projects?)
- skills required
  - c++
  - python
  - UI designer
  - UX
  - writing (with different languages?)
  - screenshots and screencasts
- level of skills
  - beginner
  - knowleged
  - advanced

We should also define

- if the tagging is done in a yaml section at the beggining of the markdown file,
- if a yaml file should be created for each project or
- if one big yaml file should have all the taggin.
