### Thoughts

- Allow editing of multiple items
- Avoid collapsing / expading sections
- Avoid scrollbars
- (Radio) Buttons instead of select boxes
- Fast show / hide of single palettes
- Fast show / hide of all palettes
- Integrate windows and palettes
- Have good defaults
- Focus on inspiring good workflows instead of allowing extreme configurability
- Avoid too many palettes being open at once
- Windows (that manage resources) should be hidden as fast as possible
- Resources (colors, styles, ...) should be created (and managed) in the context where they are used
- Compact layout
