# Grayscale and black and white PDF

Scribus does not seem to be able to produce pure grayscale or black and white PDF.

Before modifying the code we need:

- what are the ways to achieve grayscale and black and white PDFs?
- what are the exact needs of the printers?

This seems to be mostly useful for people doing comics.
