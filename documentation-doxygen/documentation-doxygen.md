# Improve the Doxygen documentation

- [x] publish the Doxygen documentation
      - <http://impagina.org/dox>
- [ ] keep the Doxygen documentation up to date
- [ ] Improve the quality of the Doxygen relevant comments in the source code

## Adopt a file

We can ask the Scribus users to help crowdsource the documentation of the Scribus code.

The first step would be to make sure that every Scribus file has a Doxygen comment at its beginning explaining what the content of the file is.

- [ ] Define which files should be commented
- [ ] Write an how-to for writing such a comment
- [ ] Create a platform listing all the files with
      - a list of all relevant files
      - showing the status (no documentation, some discussion, basic documentation, good documentation)
      - giving a way to browse the code and type the documentation
      - allow comments
- [ ] Manage the patches
