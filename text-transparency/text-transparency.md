# separate text and frame transparencies

it should not be a very hard task, since all the
code to manage the transparency is already in scribus. it's more or less
about adding the right settings in the UI, some switches in the code
and, probably, refactor parts of it so that you don't end up with lot of
duplicated code.
and you have to do this for the on screen display, the pdf output, the
printing code (and possibly a few other export options)

it will take some time to code of all of that, but it should not be
very difficult to program.
