12:26 < a-l-e> prp-e: some time ago christoph wrote that a team is working on it...
12:26 < a-l-e> there have been a few tries to implement it, but none of them has lead to something usable.
12:28 < a-l-e> if you have the skills to work on it, what i can suggest you, is to do small patches that go in that direction.
12:28 < prp-e> I am a native Persian speaker, I can help, if you would like.
12:28 < a-l-e> well, a c++ native speaker would be more helpful, there :-)
12:28 < a-l-e> you need some math skills too
12:29 < a-l-e> and you need lot lot of patience, too...
12:33 < a-l-e> you should read about what has already been done, and try to find out what are the small changes that can be done to get it there...
12:34 < a-l-e> there are two sources of code you will have to read: the indic version of scribus (which does work, but is not integrated into the main scribus code) and the work pierre did a few years ago.
12:35 < prp-e> OK, if there's a git or launchpad repository, I would read sources.
