# Resources management

this is a meta project.

- fonts
- colors
- page sizes

- how to add a new resource directly from the place where it's being used (like creating a style from the selection or adding a new color from the PP).
- we have a short selection of most used values and we want to get to the full list of resources.  
  as an example, once we have such a mechanism, we might want to only show the fonts and colors in use in each selection list and rely on a "more..." action to render the full list.
