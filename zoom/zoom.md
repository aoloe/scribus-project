# Zoom

- when zooming with the scrollwheel, the cursor position should be used as a reference
- when zooming with the +/- shortcuts, the current behavior using the selection as a reference is ok
- when using the spinboxes in the status bar it should use the center of the viewport

## Status bar

- remove the +/- lens buttons
- eventually remove the 1 lens button
- eventually remove the spinbox (are typing and scrollwheel not enough? but qt offers handy shortcuts when using the spinboxes: ctrl, shift, ...)
- get the up and down arrow keys to work in the text field

The current layout can be moved to a Zoom toolbar
