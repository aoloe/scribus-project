# Magic wand deprecation

The magic wand allows to copy formattings from a frame to another one.

It should be removed and replaced by frame styles and "create style based on selection"

- define a frame styles dialog
- implement frame styles
- add frame styles to .SLA
- add to the Properties palette
- define rules for applying local formattings to frames with a style
- allow to create any type of style from a selection (should a different style create based on the type of selection? should it a command on the selection or should the style dialog have a button: "pick a style"?)
