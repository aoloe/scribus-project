# Font manager

In the Scribus preferences, you can

- enable and disable fonts
- define how a font behaves when embedded
- add additional paths where Scribus should look for fonts

## Possible improvmenets

- let the user define, export,  and import sets of fonts (simple list of fonts to be activated / deactivated / with settings)
- re-scan for available fonts without restarting scribus
  - allow full management when documents are open.
  - if a font disappears and is used in an open document, ask for subsitution.
  - if a font is subsituted in adocument, offer to replace it with the real one.
