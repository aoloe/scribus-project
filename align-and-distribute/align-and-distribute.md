# Improvements to align and distribute

Align and distribute can be used for other context than the items:

- aligning the image inside of the frame
- aligning and distributing nodes while editing a shape

We could add new tabs for those mode or only show specific tabs when in each mode.

## Align the image in its frame

In the align and distribute dialog we should have a tab dedicated to the alignement of images inside of a frame:

- the dialog should open with this tab active, when the user is in image edit mode.
- optionally, we should consider removing the tabs from the dialog
