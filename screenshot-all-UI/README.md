# Repository of all Scribus Dialog Boxes

* All screenshots are of Scribus v1.5.1 r203xx and released under (enter open source license here)
* Function is to give translators, designers, developers a context for the content shown in dialogs. 
* Will be a mixture of screenshots from each platform Scribus is supported on. 

## Comments

ale:

- license will probably be GPL, since the dialogs themselves are under the GPL license
- the perfect solution would probably be to have a scribus scripts to open each dialog and then do a screenshot
- but we could also create a sikuli script to do it.
- we could have an API providing the links to the screenshot for each dialog, OS, version of scribus, language...
- and a web interface to query them
- i will rename this dialog to "screenshot-all-dialogs"...
- we might screenshot the whole UI (also the navigation...)
- i can work on the API part and put it on impagina.org...
