If a text frame is welded to a picture frame, allow to define it as a dynamic caption and read/write the caption from/to the image metadata.


## Notes

- The content of the text frame would be updated each time the image is redrawn (if the text is not in edit mode).
- The image metadata gets written when the text frame leaves the edit modus.
- Only one text frame per welding set can be defined as a caption.
- The welding set can only contain one single image to allow captions to be defined.

## Questions
- are there other cases of dynamic texts taht could be defined?
